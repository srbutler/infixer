### Infixer

This is a backup repository for a Python project focused on testing ways to improve morphological segmentation in low-resource languages that have complicated, non-concatenative morphological patterns.

The code is admittedly obtuse, and I'm not currently working on it. If interested in running it, there are main functions in `preprocessing_test.py` and `evaluation_test.py` that run over the pre-tokenized Tagalog data in the data/ directory. 

If you make use of this project in an academic or commercial environment, please cite the associated publication:

Please contact me if you have any questions and I'll do my best to respond.
